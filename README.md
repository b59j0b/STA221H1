Assignment Instructions
Due Date: March   14th, 2025 at   11:59PM on Crowdmark
Instructions
This is an individual assignment. You are expected to   work   on   this   independently.   You   are   more   than welcome to discuss ideas, code, concepts, etc., regarding this   assignment with your classmates. Please do not share your code or your written text with your peers. It   is   expected   that   all code and written work should be written by yourself. Please note, this assignment   is   fairly open, so   the   context   of   most   of   the   work   completed   here   should   not   match   your   peers.
Synopsis of   the Assignment
In this assignment, use the provided dataset and R to complete tasks that we have   learned   in this   course   so far.
Submission Format and Instructions
Your final submission will be in PDF files that   shows   (1) R   code,   (2)   R   output,   and   (3) your   written answers. Here are some suggested   ways you   can   create your   final   submission:
•         Use Microsoft Word to type out your answers.   Screenshot your R output and place these   images throughout the document. For the R code, either copy/paste as   text   or   screenshot.
•         Use an app like Notability, OneNote, etc., where you can write/type your   answers   and   include   screenshots   of   your   R   code   and   output.
•         Use RMarkdown and knit to a PDF. Alternatively, you can knit to an   HTML   file   and   then   save it   as   a   PDF.
How you create the final file is up to you,   as long   as   it   is   clear   and   organized.   You   don’t   want   the   TA to be frustrated while marking your work!
You will submit your solutions on Crowdmark. There will be   a   different upload box   for   each   question, so it is recommended that you place each question   on   different pages.
Late or Missing   Submissions
If   the assignment is not submitted by the due date, it will be   subject   to   a   late penalty   of   20% per   day. No extensions will be provided for the   assignment.
Alternatively, if   the assignment is missed due to an illness   or personal   emergency please   fill   out   the form. listed   in the   syllabus.
Question   1 (5   marks)
The dataset that you will be using is a sample of   Uber   and Lyft rides   in   Boston,   MA   between Nov. 26, 2018 and Dec.   12, 2018. The response variable is ‘price’   .   It   is   a   condensed version   of the   dataset   found   here:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma/data.   Use the dataset posted o代 写STA221H1 The Practice of Statistics II (LEC0101) Winter 2025R
代做程序编程语言n Quercus rather than downloading from this website   as they are different.Download the dataset from Quercus and read it into   R. Write   4-6   sentences   introducing   your   dataset. You should be explaining your chosen dataset to someone who   isn’t   familiar   with   it.   You should introduce the general topic area and   any important   variables.   (Think   of   this   as   an   introduction to a report where you analyze this dataset.)
Question 2 (5   marks)
Fit a multiple linear regression model in R using the data. It is up   to   you   to   decide   the predictor   variables.
Clearly state what your response and predictor variables are.   Show the standard R   output using   the summary()   function.
It is not   necessary to use a model   selection algorithm.
Question 3 (15   marks)
Check the assumptions using the residuals.   Show the appropriate plots. For each of   the 4 assumptions, you should state how well the assumption is   satisfied, referencing   applicable plots   as necessary.
For   the   purposes   of   this   assignment, even   if   the   assumptions   are   not   met, please   proceed   with   the rest   of   the   assignment.
Question 4 (6   marks)
For   TWO   of   your   predictors, provide   an   interpretation   of   the   slope. Provide   an   interpretation   of the intercept. Does the intercept have a meaningful interpretation in practice?
Question 5 (10   marks)
State the hypotheses and conclusion to the ANOVA F-test and t-tests for   each   slope.
Additionally, interpret   the   coefficient   of   determination. (For   ease   of   marking, please   show   the   standard R output using the summary() function in your Question   5   answer – the   same   one   from   Question 2.)
Question 6   (6   marks)
For   a   combination   of   predictor   variable   values   of   your   choice, calculate   the   confidence   interval and prediction interval. Provide an interpretation for each of   the   intervals. You   are   encouraged to   choose a combination of   predictor values that makes sense and would have   a meaningful interpretation.
Question 7 (10   marks)Fit another linear regression model with the same response variable. Choose a model   where   either the second model’s predictors are a subset of   the   first model’s predictors   OR the   first   model’s   predictors   are   a   subset   of   the   second   model’s   predictors.
Use   2 methods   to   determine   which   model   is   preferable.   Show   and   explain   the   results   of   both   of these methods. Do the 2 methods agree?
